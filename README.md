# Rock Paper Scissors   
Description   
Third project in The Odin Project â€” a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. This updated version includes a basic user interface, allowing the game to be played directly in the browser without using the console. It demonstrates JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction through buttons and on-screen messages.   

The goal of this project is to get comfortable with JavaScript functions, control flow, DOM events, and dynamic content updates in the browser.
