# Rock Paper Scissors   
Description   
Third project in The Odin Project - a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The game runs entirely in the browser console and demonstrates basic JavaScript logic and user interaction using prompt and console.log.

The goal of this project is to get comfortable with JavaScript functions, control flow, loops, and user input/output.
